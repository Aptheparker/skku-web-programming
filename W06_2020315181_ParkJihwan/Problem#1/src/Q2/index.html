      <h1>The paragraph below has been extracted from the speech delivered by Steve Jobs at Stanford University</h1>
      <p>"None of this had even a hope of any practical application in my life. But 10 years later, when we were
        designing the first Macintosh computer, it all came back to me. And we designed it all into the Mac. It was
        the first computer with beautiful typography. And since Windows just copied the Mac, it's likely that no
        personal computer would have them. If I had never dropped out, I would have never dropped in on this calligraphy
        class, and personal computers might not have the wonderful typography that they do. Of course it was impossible
        to connect the dots looking forward when I was in college. But it was very, very clear looking backwards 10
        years later."</p>
